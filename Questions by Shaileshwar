# Problem Statement
Write a Python program that processes a list of student grades. The program should:

Take a list of student names and their respective grades in multiple subjects as input.
Compute and output:
The average grade for each student.
The highest grade for each student.
The lowest grade for each student.
**Sample Input**
```
3
Alice 85 90 92
Bob 78 88 82
Charlie 95 87 91
```
**Sample Output**
```
Name: Alice
Average Grade: 89.0
Highest Grade: 92
Lowest Grade: 85
Name: Bob
Average Grade: 82.67
Highest Grade: 88
Lowest Grade: 78
Name: Charlie
Average Grade: 91.0
Highest Grade: 95
Lowest Grade: 87
```
# Solution
```py test.py -r 'python3 test.py'
<template>
def process_studentgrades():
    """
    Processes student grades to compute the average, highest, and lowest grades
    for each student and outputs the results in a specific format.
    """
    # Read the number of students
    <sol>
    n = int(input())

    #Loop over the number of students
    for  in range(n):

        grades = list(map(int, data[1:]))

        average = sum(grades) / len(grades)

        print(f"Highest Grade: {highest}")
        print(f"Lowest Grade: {lowest}")
        print()  # Blank line between students

#Call the function to start processing
process_student_grades()
